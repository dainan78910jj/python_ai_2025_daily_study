Task : Develop a Simulation System for a Zoo

# Background

You are tasked with developing an object - oriented system to simulate a zoo. The system should manage different types of animals and their interactions within the park. The goal is to create a dynamic environment where animals can eat, sleep, and interact with each other and the park' s visitors.

# Specifications

1. Basic Objects
    - Animal : The base class for all types of animals. Common attributes may include name, age, and energy level. Basic methods might be to eat, sleep, and make sounds.
    - Herbivores and Carnivores : Subclasses that inherit from Animal, with specific characteristics and behaviors.
    - Visitors : A class to represent the visitors in the park, with attributes like name and age.
2. Features
    - Create specific animal species such as lions, elephants, and giraffes, with unique characteristics and behaviors.
    - Implement interactions between animals, like hunting or playing.
    - Allow visitors to " feed " certain animal species, affecting their energy levels.
    - Simulate a day in the zoo, where animals follow their natural routines and interact with visitors.
3. Challenges
    - Managing the energy levels of animals and ensuring they eat and rest regularly.
    - Modeling predator - prey relationships in a way that is balanced and doesn' t lead to any species quickly being "eradicated" from the simulation.
    - reating an engaging and interactive experience for the visitor through the interface.
