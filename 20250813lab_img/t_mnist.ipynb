    "Data Transformation\n",
    "In this lab, you will continue working with image-based datasets, where each image is composed of pixel values. Our goal is to begin preparing this data so that it can be used effectively in a machine learning model. You will walk through several key steps in the preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "The first part involves transforming the data so that it falls within a more manageable range.\n",
    "Right now, each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255.\n",
    " \n",
    "Consider what effect this might have on your model, and think about how you could convert this to a more consistent format — something that many machine learning models handle better.\n",
    "Once you’ve made that adjustment, try running the code and examining the output. One way to verify that your transformation worked is to inspect a single image and print out only certain values — for example, those that are greater than zero.\n",
    "This can help you:\n",
    "- Get a feel for what kind of data you're working with\n",
    "- Confirm that your processing is doing what you expect\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Reshaping the Data\n",
    "Next, think about how the image data is currently structured.\n",
    "Each image is a 2D array — in this case, 28 by 28 pixels.\n",
    "However, many machine learning algorithms expect input in a different format.\n",
    "Reflect on how you might reshape or reorganize the data so that each image is represented as a single vector rather than a matrix.\n",
    " \n",
    "Checking the Shape\n",
    "Once you've restructured the data, it's a good idea to print out the shape of the dataset both before and after this transformation.\n",
    "Doing so will help you:\n",
    "- Understand how the data has changed\n",
    "- Confirm that your reshaping step worked as intended\n",
    " \n",
    "Things to Reflect On:\n",
    "- Why might it be helpful to scale pixel values to a different range?\n",
    "- How does viewing specific pixel values help you debug your preprocessing steps?\n",
    "- Why do some models require flat vectors instead of 2D matrices?\n",
    "- How does reshaping the data affect the input size for your future model?\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Final Note\n",
    "Take your time and make sure you understand why you're performing each step — not just how to do it. These concepts are essential when working with real-world image data and will come up again in future labs and projects."
