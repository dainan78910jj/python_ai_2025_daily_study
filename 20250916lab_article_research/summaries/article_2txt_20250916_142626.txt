Here are three bullet points summarizing the article:

• Researchers found that moderate caffeinated coffee consumption (1-3 cups per day) in midlife was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging 30 years later in women.
• The study's lead author noted that it's not just any caffeinated drink that has health-preserving effects, and that cola or other caffeinated sodas were linked to lower healthy aging rates.
• While the findings suggest coffee may be beneficial for healthy aging, experts caution that individual factors such as lifestyle, hormone levels, and potential interactions with other medications should also be considered before adding or increasing coffee consumption.
