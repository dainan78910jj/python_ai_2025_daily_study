Here are three bullet points summarizing the article:

• Experts recommend listening to calming content before sleep, as engaging materials can disrupt sleep and instead suggest trying a predictable sound, like white noise, to signal that it's bedtime.

• To maximize benefits and avoid potential negative effects on sleep quality, setting an auto timer to mute sounds after falling asleep and using consistent, calming noises are recommended, while proactive daytime strategies for quieting racing thoughts should also be explored.
