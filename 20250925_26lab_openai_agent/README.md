Todays Lab 20250925:
 
 
You are going to create your own agent! 
Give it a name (e.g "Teacher", "Poet", "Jokester")
 
Use Runner.run(agent, prompt) to send a task to your agent.
Use trace("...") to label the run (for debugging/tracking).
Print the final output.
Create three different agents (e.g., a Joke Teller, a Motivational Coach, and a Math Tutor).
For each agent:
Give it 2–3 prompts.
Compare how the outputs change depending on its instructions.

Build a mini multi-agent system where:

One agent writes a short story.
Another agent reviews it for grammar.
A third agent summarizes the story.
Use Runner to pass the text between agents

A .py file with at least 3 different agents tested.
A short write-up:
What worked well?
How did the agent’s role (instructions) change the output?
What was the funniest or most surprising result
