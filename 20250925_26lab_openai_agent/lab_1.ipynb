      "    1. **Start with a strong foundation**: Make sure you understand the basics of mathematics, including fractions, decimals, percentages, algebra, and geometry.\n",
      "    2. **Practice regularly**: Practice is essential to build confidence and fluency in mathematics. Try to practice solving math problems every day for at least 30 minutes.\n",
      "    3. **Break down complex concepts into smaller pieces**: Break down complex mathematical concepts into smaller, manageable pieces. Focus on one concept at a time and make sure you understand it before moving on to the next.\n",
      "    4. **Use visual aids**: Visual aids such as graphs, charts, and diagrams can help you visualize mathematical concepts and make them easier to understand.\n",
      "    5. **Watch video lessons**: Video lessons can provide an alternative way to learn mathematics and offer additional explanations and examples that you may not have seen in class or textbook.\n",
      "    6. **Work with a study group**: Working with friends or classmates who are also learning mathematics can be very helpful. You can learn from each other, share resources, and stay motivated.\n",
      "    7. **Use online resources**: There are many online resources available to help you learn mathematics, including Khan Academy, Wolfram Alpha, and MIT OpenCourseWare.\n",
      "    8. **Take your time**: Don't rush through mathematical problems or concepts. Take your time and make sure you understand each step before moving on.\n",
      "    9. **Teach someone else**: Teaching someone else what you have learned can help you reinforce your own understanding of the material.\n",
      "    10. **Stay organized**: Keep all your math textbooks, notes, and practice materials organized and easily accessible.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Additionally, here are some specific tips for different types of mathematics:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    * For algebra, learn to factorize equations and use algebraic identities.\n",
      "    * For geometry, learn to visualize shapes and understand spatial relationships.\n",
      "    * For calculus, learn to apply limits and derivatives to real-world problems.\n",
      "    * For statistics, learn to summarize data and apply statistical concepts to meaningful conclusions.\n",

If `n` is 1 or 2, it simply returns the corresponding Fibonacci numbers. Otherwise, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers and then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` reaches `n`. Inside the loop, it appends the sum of the last two elements in `fib_sequence` to the end of the list.\n",
